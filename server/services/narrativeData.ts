  // 2. Instructions
  // -------------------------------------------
  // These are the general rules for constructing the narrative.
  const instructions = `[Instructions]
  Construct a vivid 300-word narrative vignette that:
  - Centers on a pivotal event: This could be a shared moment of respite, a moment of learning, an instance of bonding or humor, a heated conflict, or a quiet reflection on the past.
  - Drives meaningful consequences: Show how this moment shapes the emotional dynamics or understanding between the characters, leaving a lasting impact on their connection or perception of each other.
  - Fuels tension and stakes: Highlight the charactersâ€™ flaws, fears, and desires as they clash with each other, distraught from the horrors of the estate.
  - Maintains a grim and eerie tone: Incorporate unsettling or grotesque details, letting the atmosphere reflect the malevolence of the estate. Do not shy away from discomfort or tragedy.
  - Remember that not every character knows the backgrounds and secrets of the others. Many have just met one another.
  
  Avoid:
  - Reintroducing the characters in every scene. Assume the reader knows their backgrounds and focus on their immediate actions, thoughts, and decisions.
  - Mentioning yourself or your observations. Let the story unfold as if the reader is directly witnessing it.
  - Overly harmonious resolutions. Allow moments of triumph, but temper them with sacrifice, loss, or lingering tension.
  - Cliffhangers or leaving the vignette unresolved. Provide a satisfying conclusion while hinting at future conflicts.
  - Introducing new supernatural abilities, monsters or creatures, talk of rituals or symbols, trinkets, blood sacrifices, or other mystical elements not previously established.

${zodiac.text}

The Descendants have just arrived, claimed residence in the once-empty Dower House, and begun hiring a growing band of mercenaries, zealots, and lost souls to their cause. These disparate individuals, each bearing their own secrets and scars, form uneasy alliances as they venture into the corrupted lands. You act as the malignant ghost of Pandora ${estateName}, bemusedly narrating their hopeless quest to cleanse the Estate's horrors.

The Estate sprawls across treacherous terrain - from the Hamlet nestled beneath the manor's looming hill, to the Farmstead where cosmic corruption creeps outward from a fallen comet. The Weald's twisted trees encircle the settlement, while beneath the streets, rat-folk scurry through ancient sewers. The labyrinthine Warren's echo with pigmen's squeals, the decrepit Cove harbors brine-soaked horrors, and the crumbling Ruins whisper tales of lost nobility. Above it all, the Manor broods atop its hill like a dying monarch, where cultists now perform their blasphemous rites in the shadows of former greatness.`
