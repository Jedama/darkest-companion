    "description": "The Bone Soldier advances with the practiced economy of a trained warrior, its movements stripped of hesitation and fear. Though flesh has long since fallen away, the habits of the sword remain—measured steps, precise cuts, and an uncanny sense of timing that recalls a life once spent in disciplined combat.",
    "history": "The ruins are crowded with the remains of those who once served, defended, or died with steel in hand. Some of these dead do not rest. Bound by the Ancestor's necromancers, the Bone Soldier rises with fragments of its former purpose intact. It does not think as it once did, but the motions of war endure, etched into bone by repetition and duty.",
    "summary": "A disciplined undead melee combatant that retains the weapon skill and precision it possessed in life.",
