  "description": "The last known survivor of a massacred sylvan coven, the Sibyl is a traumatized vagrant whose meek demeanor conceals a volatile connection to her goddess, The Radiance. While she can channel this divine power to mend wounds, her profound grief and simmering hatred can transform her into a conduit for a destructive, hateful light that scorches the earth and twists life into unnatural forms.",
  "history": "Born an outcast and branded a 'half-breed', the Sibyl found sanctuary in a secluded coven. This peace was shattered when crusaders destroyed her home, forcing her to hide while her kin were slaughtered. Now, she wanders in a desperate search for other survivors, her journey fueled by a deep survivor's guilt and a growing hatred for the cruel world that took everything from her. Her faith is her only comfort, but her goddess's power is as dangerous as it is divine.",
