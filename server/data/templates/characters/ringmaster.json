  "description": "The Ringmaster is the charismatic and ruthless leader of the infamous traveling fighting arena: The Butcher's Circus. She delights in orchestrating spectacles of combat, pushing contestants to their limits for the entertainment of bloodthirsty crowds. To her, everything is a performace, and what is a show without violence?",
  "history": "The Ringmaster built the Butcher's Circus from nothing, transforming a backwater fighting pit into a notorious traveling arena that draws desperate warriors and bloodthirsty crowds alike. Her caravan arrived at the Hamlet a month after the Heirs, setting up her arena to provide entertainment for the fighters between expeditions. But the Hamlet proved too tame, too mundane and she has demanded permission to join the expeditions, demanding no payment but spectacle.",
