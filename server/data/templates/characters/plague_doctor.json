  "description": "The Plague Doctor, is primarily driven by her fervor to practice medicine and unlock the secrets of life and death. Ostracized for her radical methods, she now makes use of the Heirs' resources, offering her medical expertise on missions in return for the freedom to conduct her experiments at the hamlet.",
  "history": "Once a top student embroiled in scandal due to her unconventional theories, the Plague Doctor's intense curiosity pushed her beyond academic boundaries. Her breakthrough came when she revived the cadaver of her deceased professor during an unauthorized experiment. Haunted by the consequences of her actions, she was compelled to leave her former life behind, seeking refuge and opportunity in the shadows of the hamlet's resources.",
