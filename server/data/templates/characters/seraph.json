    "summary": "A devout warrior who hears the voice of 'The Light', the Seraph has transformed from a humble farmer to a zealous crusader. Burned and scarred from a near-death experience, she now serves as a vessel for divine power, though the true nature of the entity guiding her remains ambiguous.",
    "history": "Born into poverty, the Seraph's life changed when she began hearing voices  from The Light. Believing herself chosen, she took up arms, causing a schism in the church. Hunted by witch hunter Mathis, she was captured and sentenced to burn. During her execution, a miraculous intervention saved her, and though leaving her horribly scarred it elevated her to a figure of deity, and she went on to lead many holy crusades. Now, guided by the voice, she has come to the Hamlet to purge evil.",
