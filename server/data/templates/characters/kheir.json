  "description": "The Heir to the estate is a brilliant scholar and capable manager who is trying to cope in this world of horrors far beyond his comfort. Despite his meek nature, Percival's keen intellect and organizational skills prove invaluable in coordinating the chaotic efforts to reclaim his ancestral home. Though he prefers the study, he reluctantly ventures into the dungeons when the quest demands it, determined to live up to the expectations of his Sister and their family name.",
  "history": "Raised in academic circles far from the estate's dark legacy, Percival initially resisted his sister's summons. However, his sense of duty—and intellectual curiosity—ultimately drew him to the task. While he makes no pretense of physical courage, he is the backbone of the estate's logistics, handling its people with the same ease he manages its resources.",
  "summary": "The meek, cowardly Heir, a brilliant scholar with a drinking problem, who struggles to cope with horrors and is very possessive of his belongings.",
