    "summary": "The Hood is a strange and enigmatic child who, stumlbing, chases around her imaginary-or are they real?-cat and butterfly companions and talking nonsense to herself. She is unsettling in her childish ways and soft nonsensical words, but she has an unnatural sense of finding lost things and ability to convenient dodge out of danger at the perfect moment.",
    "history": "The Hood was seen as unnerving by those around her, talking to herself with a complete disregard for anyone else, save for the occasional unnerving comment. Voluptuous yet cherubic for her young age and unwanted by her family, she was sent to serve at the Hamlet's brothel. Due to her total lack of reaction, she was kicked out and now again roams the streets following her ethereal friends.",
