    "description": "The Hood is a strange and enigmatic child who stumbles around, lost in her own imaginary world, chasing her cat and butterfly companions she thinks are real, all while talking nonsense to herself. She is unsettling in her childish demeanor and soft words. Unaware to herself, she possesses an unnatural sense for finding lost things and an ability to stumble out of danger at the perfect moment.",
    "history": "The Hood was seen as unnerving by those around her, talking to herself with a complete disregard for her surroundings. Voluptuous yet cherubic for her young age and unwanted by her family, she was sent off to her local brothel. She was eventually kicked out due to her lack of reaction as the men took me. Roaming the world, her ethereal friends eventually brought her to the Hamlet.",
