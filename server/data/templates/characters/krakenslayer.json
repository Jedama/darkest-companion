  "description": "The Krakenslayer is a patient, methodical hunter who has made her name slaying massive sea beasts. She fights with chained-together twin harpoons, bleeding her prey and waiting with calculated patience for weakness to set in. Every legendary kill is commemorated with a new tattoo, each one a story she'll tell with boastful embellishment. Superstitious and territorial, she's the kind of hunter who claims first pick of any prize and leaves others to fight for scraps.",
  "history": "The Krakenslayer earned her title hunting the ocean's deadliest predators. Each tattoo tells a story: the wyrm that took three days to bleed out, the hydra whose five heads she severed one by one, the baby kraken whose mother she still seeks. She learned early that glory shared is glory wasted—other hunters slow you down, steal your kill, or die screaming when things go wrong. Better to work alone. When word of the Estate's corrupted depths and the massive creatures lurking within reached her ears she immediately started swimming.",
