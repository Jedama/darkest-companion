    "description": "The hamlet's heart, enclosed by weathered buildings that lean inward like spectators at a grim performance. Centuries-old cobblestones spiral toward the Ancestor's stern figure, while market stalls huddle beneath sagging wooden awnings. A few mounted oil lamps mark the square's corners, though most townsfolk hurry to complete their business before dusk claims the streets.",

    "title": "Ancestor's Statue",
    "description": "A commanding figure carved from dark stone that dominates the square's center, depicting the Estate's former master in formal robes, with the family's noble raven perched vigilant on the worn pedestal beside him. Decades of rain have weathered the severe features, while the granite base bears the nearly illegible remnants of the family motto. His gaze fixes southward toward the Old Road, the path that first carried his descendants back to reclaim their birthright.",

    "title": "Constabulary",
    "description": "A sturdy two-story building of fitted stone anchoring the square's northern edge. Here, the late Captain made both his fateful stands - first refusing the Ancestor's bribes to suppress the townspeople's protests, and years later organizing the hamlet's final defense against the horrors that followed. Though the building bears scars from both the Brigade's retribution and supernatural assaults, it stands as a testament to principles that proved stronger than gold.",

    "description": "Three iron-barred cells line the stone walls, their heavy doors hanging askew on rusted hinges. Iron rings and chains remain mounted at intervals, anchored deep in the masonry. The ventilation shafts show signs of hasty modification, while dried ink stains mark where the record-keeper's desk once stood, the final entries in a peculiarly gentle hand.",

    "description": "A broad chamber dominated by layers of yellowed notices - old public gathering permits visible beneath hastily sketched defense plans. The duty desk bears deep scars, some from violence, others from desperate fortification efforts. Twin staircases bracket the room: a narrow stone spiral descending to the cells, and broader wooden steps rising to the quarters above, their railings worn smooth by countless hands.",

    "description": "Simple chambers divided into sleeping quarters and a watch post overlooking the square. Empty gun racks line the walls above worn bedframes, their hooks bearing only dust. A pot-bellied stove occupies one corner, while ammunition crates serve as makeshift furniture, their contents long since expended. An open logbook still rests on the Captain's desk, its final page unfinished.",

    "description": "A dark-wood caravan decorated with brass fittings and hanging charms, positioned where afternoon light best displays its exotic wares. The merchant conducts business through a sliding panel beneath a striped awning, her collection of trinkets and talismans hanging from neat rows of hooks. A small brazier burns perpetually beside her counter, though its smoke seems to sink rather than rise.",

An array of delicate tools hangs from the awning's support beam.",

The once-cheerful facade has rotted to reveal skeletal timbers, while fallen shutters lie half-buried in years of debris. Through broken windows, rows of empty benches face a stage where tattered curtains hang like forgotten funeral shrouds.",
    "restored": "A charming oddity amid the hamlet's grimmer edifices, its peaked roof crowned with freshly painted finials. The restored facade displays whimsical carvings, while warm lamplight spills through diamond-paned windows. Inside, tiered benches face a proper stage where new velvet curtains frame performances that offer brief respite from the estate's horrors.",
