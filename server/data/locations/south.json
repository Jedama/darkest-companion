    "description": "Agricultural land stretches from the hamlet's edge toward the distant Weald. At its heart, the Mill Grounds stand in uneasy balance between salvation and corruption, where townspeople's courage drew new ward lines closer to the comet's impact site. Beyond the wards' protection, the old Apple Yard marks where cultivation gives way to fungal wilderness.",

    "description": "A broken husk of splintered timber and collapsing supports that once secured the hamlet's food stores. The loading dock has completely collapsed, leaving wagons' weathered remains half-buried in the debris. Ravens nest in the sagging rafters, their calls echoing through holes in the roof while vermin scurry through rotting grain in the shadows below.",
    "restored": "A sturdy guardian of the hamlet's sustenance risen anew. Fresh-cut timber and iron bands have replaced rotting boards, while the restored loading dock again bears the weight of harvest wagons. The upper floors now keep their precious cargo dry and secure, though workers whisper of strange sounds that still echo from the deepest storage bins.",

    "description": "A collapsed winery whose ruined vats still bear the sickly-sweet smell of fermented harvests past. Broken glass and splintered oak barrels litter the loading dock, while the pressing room's rusted machinery sits frozen in decay. In the cellar, shattered bottles tell tales of desperate looters who found only vinegar and regret.",
    "restored": "An unsettling yet vital facility risen from the old winery's bones. Dark timbers and fresh stonework frame a building that resembles a proper vintner's operation, though its true purpose is betrayed by the corpses of the Courtyard's bloodsuckers visible through leaded windows. Inside, modern distillation apparatus and cooling systems ensure a steady supply of processed blood for the hamlet's cursed residents, while the cellar holds rows of carefully labeled vials rather than wine bottles.",

    "description": "A stretch of farmland rescued from deeper corruption when the townspeople moved the Ancestor's ward stones inward, dragging the carved slabs through frozen wheat on creaking carts. Though crystalline growths still pierce the soil and the Miller's towering form stalks these grounds with hostile intent, his presence can be avoided by careful travelers. The new ward line holds just as strong as the original, preventing further corruption from spreading outward from the comet's impact site.",

Crystalline growths trace paths up its walls like frozen ivy, while the great millstone hangs motionless, caught between earthly mechanics and otherworldly forces. Through gaps in the walls, pale blue light pulses in time with distant distortions.",
    "restored": "The great wheel stands whole once more, its timbers and masonry carefully reconstructed to bridge what once floated in cosmic suspension. Though new stones and gears have replaced those too far gone, something of its time in the corruption lingers in the grain's subtle luminescence. The millstone turns again, grinding wheat from safer fields.",

The stone walls bear crystalline growths that pulse with inner light, while the well's wooden roof hangs crooked, its beams warped by forces that pull toward the inner wards. No bucket has drawn safe water here since the comet's fall.",
    "restored": "Fresh stones cap the ancient shaft, with new roof timbers replacing those warped by cosmic forces. While the water still glimmers strangely in certain lights, careful filtration and regular testing have made it safe for use once more. The old bucket chain turns true, though workers prefer to draw water in daylight hours.",

Though some older trees still bear traces of their corruption in glimmering bark and luminous leaves, their fruit grows wholesome and sweet. The replanted rows stand straight where their twisted predecessors once leaned.",
