Splintered pilings rise like ribs from the dark depths, while rusted chains and frayed ropes mark where ships once moored. The air hangs heavy with salt and decay, disturbed only by the irregular splashing of unseen things beneath the surface.",

    "description": "The longest dock reaches deep into the murky waters, its weathered planks perpetually encrusted with barnacles that seem to grow back overnight. At its far end, where chains once held something precious, starfish cluster in unnatural abundance, their forms visible even through the dark waters. Local sailors whisper of a mournful song that rises from the depths during certain moons, and how the last of House Tritonis, mad with grief, walked these boards into the freezing waters in search of their daughter's voice.",

Most stand empty now, their massive doors sealed by rust and disuse, though some serve as impromptu shelters when the nights grow long. Iron tracks embedded in the cobblestones trace paths from the docks to sealed doorways, speaking of busier days.",

    "restored": "A three-story establishment of dark timber and wrought iron, its windows glowing amber in the harbor's gloom. The carved sign of a golden hand marks the heavy oak door, while iron-bound stairs lead to private rooms above. Though ostensibly a simple tavern, the regular traffic through its back entrance tells a different story.",

Rubble resembling thick stone walls, once covered in careful records of the Estate's eldritch monuments, now bear only scorch marks and the occasional fragment of runic script. Inside, broken instruments and burned texts suggest the Ancestor's determination to claim their centuries of research for himself. A partially collapsed staircase spirals down to flooded chambers where the society's most precious archives once resided, though the rising tide has claimed whatever secrets the flames missed.",
    "restored": "A peculiar structure of rough-hewn timber and salvaged stone rises at sharp angles against the harbor sky, betraying its hasty reconstruction. Three asymmetric levels stack precariously, their peaked roofs bristling with makeshift observatories and curious instruments. While the exterior suggests improvised functionality, the interior houses carefully organized archives - newly gathered texts and specimens documenting the Estate's otherworldly elements. The reinstated scholars, like their predecessors, focus particularly on the Red Hook's significance.",
