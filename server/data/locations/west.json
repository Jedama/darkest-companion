The noble house's tower now holds the sanitarium, and with the Weald's miasma it mark this district as a place to avoid. The Caretaker still maintains his provisions, and the Survivalist alone finds comfort beneath the twisted trees.",

Within, grand halls have been converted to wards, and the wine cellar holds patients rather than vintages.",

    "description": "A circular chamber at the tower's peak where leather-bound medical texts share shelf space with older volumes from the building's nobler days. A broad desk faces the window overlooking the Weald's edge, while brass-bound water tanks occupy the floor above, their pipes descending through the ceiling. The doctor's journals lie open beside a brass microscope, their margins filled with increasingly erratic observations.",

    "description": "Long rows of narrow beds line the walls of what might once have been a grand ballroom, its high ceiling still bearing traces of gilt beneath years of lamp smoke. Iron brackets now hold privacy screens between patients, while wheeled carts carry implements whose purpose is best left unquestioned. The room's tall windows have been fitted with iron bars, as much to keep things out as in.",

Wooden tables bear the scars of spilled reagents, while the old dumbwaiter now carries specimens between floors instead of dishes.",

    "description": "The ragged border where the hamlet's influence fails against encroaching wilderness. Here, twisted trees lean over crumbling stone walls, their branches tangled with the remnants of old rope from the Gallows Tree. That ancient execution ground still bears its grim fruit, though none can say whether the swaying corpses move from wind or something else. Above the diseased canopy rises the Tall Tree, its uppermost branches lost in mist where the Shrieker's vast nest blocks out the sky. Fungal growths creep closer with each season, their phosphorescent gleam visible through the undergrowth.",

Rusted spits and broken benches lie half-buried in weeds, while dark stains mark where revelers spilled their drinks in hasty flight. The old solstice grounds stand empty now, though some say the flames died only after the last celebrant vanished into the Weald's darkness.",
    "restored": "A welcoming circle of warmth and light at the hamlet's edge. Iron spits turn above carefully maintained flames, while sturdy benches and barrels provide comfort for those seeking respite from the Estate's horrors. Though the Weald's shadows press close, they cannot breach the ring of firelight where townsfolk still gather to share meals and memories of better days.",

    "restored": "A well-ordered pavilion where brass instruments gleam on sturdy tables, dedicated to the endless task of mapping the Estate's fluid boundaries. Fresh charts line the walls, each noting how paths and landmarks drift between surveys. The cartographer works by lamplight into the night, knowing tomorrow's expedition might find everything changed anew.",
