  "description": "The Physician treats the hamlet's psychological afflictions from behind her ornate mask, her soft-spoken manner creating a soothing atmosphere for her vapor treatments. Where the Sanitarium's walls once echoed only with Daphne's clinical approach, the Physician's gentle voice now guides patients through mental transformations achieved through her aromatic concoctions and meditative techniques. Though her methods diverge dramatically from conventional medicine, their effectiveness cannot be denied.",

Their paths eventually diverged as the Chirurgeon embraced increasingly invasive trepanation methods, while Imogen pursued the healing properties of vapors and meditation. The hamlet's unique afflictions drew her from her travels, offering minds that conventional medicine had failed to heal.",
