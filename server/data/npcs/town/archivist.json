  "name": "Edwin",
  "description": "A meticulous keeper of records who survived the initial chaos following the Ancestor's suicide, now serving as head librarian. Though outwardly dedicated to preserving knowledge, his careful movements and quiet intensity suggest deeper preoccupations. Burn scars peek from beneath his high collar. He traces them with candle flame when he thinks himself alone, still regretting not following the previous Abbot into banishment.",
  "history": "Originally served as assistant to the previous librarian, whom he quietly revered. Before the courtyard was sealed, the cursed sycophants broke into the hamlet. The Archivist would have died alongside his mentor, if not for the previous Abbot arriving with torch and fury. Nightmares still haunt him, visions of becoming one of the courtyard's droning horrors, and one night that fear overruled reason, and he unleashed the purifying flame upon his own flesh.",
  "summary": "archivist (Edwin) -- A meticulous and obsessive Archivist, scarred by fire, who is dedicated to preserving knowledge while harboring an unsettling fascination with purification.",
