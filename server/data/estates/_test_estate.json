In battle, it transforms into a spectral steed of blue flames to assist the Cataphract. Together they form an unstoppable cavalry unit, using their combined skills to charge into battle and vanquish foes.",

      "description": "Once a simple farmer who joined the war to save his family from famine, Reynauld rose unexpectedly through martial prowess to become a legendary commander. The horrors he witnessed and his own transformation into a hardened warrior left him unable to return to his former life. His peculiar habit of collecting trinkets from fallen enemies and his distinctive whistling became well-known among his men. Now drawn to the Estate, he seeks not holy war but a deeper purpose in combating forces that threaten the very fabric of humanity.",
      "history": "Born to till the soil, Reynauld lived a peaceful life with his wife and young son until famine threatened their survival. He joined the army as a conscript, leaving behind promises of return. His natural leadership and battlefield courage saw him rise from farmer to feared commander. In a pivotal moment, he spared The Warlord, recognizing the futility of endless conflict. This act, coupled with his growing disillusionment, led him to abandon both the war and thoughts of returning home, knowing he could no longer fit into that simple life.",

His goal is to document and preserve the treasures of this land before they are lost to the encroaching darkness, a task for which he will risk life and limb—preferably someone else's.",

Voluptuous yet cherubic for her young age and unwanted by her family, she was sent to serve at the Hamlet's brothel. Due to her total lack of reaction, she was kicked out and now again roams the streets following her ethereal friends.",

He wields a massive blade with raw power but lacking precision, channeling his life of trauma into devastating attacks or protective strength. Though his body is ravaged, he endures with unshakable resolve and a sense of quiet purpose.",
      "history": "The Leper was a compassionate king known for his humility and kindness, often visiting the sick and dying against the protests of his advisors. It was during these visits that he contracted leprosy, sealing his fate as a cursed and broken man. When symptoms began to show, his advisors sought to exploit his vulnerability, plotting to usurp his throne and strip his kingdom of its wealth. Despite his declining health, Baldwin uncovered their treachery and took up his ceremonial, gold-plated sword—a symbol of his authority that had never been used in battle. Driven by fury and betrayal, he slaughtered the scheming advisors in a single night of bloody vengeance, before abdicating the throne and exiling himself. He now wanders the land as a warrior-poet, his body ravaged but his spirit unbroken, seeking redemption and solace in the beauty of the world.",

Left with an empty chest and overwhelmed by newfound empathy and pain, the Offering fled her cult. She now walks a precarious path between life and death, driven to understand and share in others' suffering.",

The Therapist uses a twisted blend of medical science and eldritch power to create codependency, offering temporary relief at the cost of his patients' free will.

His ambition led him to a pact with a sinister entity he calls 'Father,' granting him profound power to manipulate the psyche. His philosophy warped: why cure illness when you can control it? Now, he preys on the desperate, creating a cycle of reliance that serves both his god-complex and the unknowable agenda of the being he serves.",
