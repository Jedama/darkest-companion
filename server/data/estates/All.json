      "summary": "The Zenith is an acrobatic fighter who inspires allies with his charm and skill with a spear. Sworn to a god of honor and brotherhood, he uses bravado to distract from horrors. He can unleash the Golden Janissary Style for powerful combinations against eldritch and unholy foes. Unarmored but mobile, his hedonistic nature may clash with the pious or those with jealous spouses.",
      "history": "The Zenith grew up in Great Forks, the City of a Thousand Temples, where he honed his charm and social skills. He trained rigorously with a near-forgotten order, mastering the art of fighting creatures of darkness. A tragic event involving the death of his friend Keli drives his actions. This past failure fuels his determination to protect others and redeem himself through his current adventures.",
