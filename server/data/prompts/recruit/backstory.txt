SETTING: The Estate - once a noble family holding, now a corrupted land containing the Manor, the Courtyard, the Hamlet, and surrounding regions

BACKSTORY:
The Ancestor's dark experiments left the ${estateName} estate corrupted and overrun with horrors. When his descendants arrived, they set in motion a desperate quest to reclaim these lands. The Hamlet now serves as a base for adventurers who venture into corrupted dungeons in small teams, clearing horrors room by room. Death is common. Survivors return to rest, resupply, and navigate the complex web of relationships, rivalries, and shifting allegiances that form between those who face death together. The Hamlet has sent out a call for aid, and many who arrive have answered it—willing to fight the horrors for coin, purpose, or survival. But others come for different reasons: curiosity, opportunism, or pulled by something ineffable.

The Light is the dominant faith in these lands, though a multitude faiths exist. Characters who list no religious affiliation typically still acknowledge the Light's existence—they simply don't attend services or follow doctrine strictly.
Magic and fantastical elements exist but are rare. Witnessing genuine magic, eldritch phenomena, or supernatural abilities would shock most ordinary people.
