SETTING: The Estate - once a noble family holding, now a corrupted land containing the Manor, Hamlet, and surrounding regions

BACKSTORY:
The Ancestor, Pandora ${estateName}, was born to a noble family in decline. Upon inheriting the estate, he hosted extravagant parties for nobility in the Courtyard where decadence and debauchery flourished. Growing tired of these parasitic nobles, he encountered a Countess who revealed herself as a blood-drinking monster. After killing her, he mixed her blood into wine served at his gatherings, transforming the guests into similar creatures.

When a drop of this blood touched the Ancestor's lips, he received a vision of something ancient sleeping beneath the Manor. Obsessed with this revelation, he began excavating beneath his home, hiring workers and acquiring occult artifacts through mariners who sailed to distant shores.

As the excavation progressed, the Ancestor conducted increasingly disturbing experiments:
- Practiced necromancy and blood magic
- Created hybrid creatures using pig flesh (creating the Swine)
- Collaborated with the young Horticulturist who later transformed through fungal experiments (becoming the Hag)
- Discovered ancient aqueducts and tunnels (the Warrens) where he disposed of failed experiments
- Erected celestial slabs at the Miller's farmstead that later attracted a cosmic entity

When his fortune began to dwindle, the Ancestor took desperate measures:
- Made deals with sea creatures by sacrificing the Waif in the Cove (Later known as the Siren)
- Sank the mariners' ship when they demanded more payment
- Hired brigands to massacre protesting townsfolk
- Raised an army of undead in the ruins of his ancestral manor

Eventually, the excavation reached "the Darkest Dungeon," revealing an eldritch entity. After showing this to a Prophet (who went mad and blinded himself), the Ancestor retreated to his study. As townsfolk stormed the Manor, he wrote letters to his heir, then ended his life - not in despair, but as the final step in a ritual to bind himself to the Heart as its Herald.

AFTERMATH:
The Ancestor's actions unleashed various horrors across the Estate:
- The Countess reawakened in the Courtyard
- A cosmic comet crashed into the Farmstead
- Necromancers continued raising the dead in the Ruins
- Pigmen multiplied in the Warrens
- The Hag formed a coven, corrupting the Weald and its nearby lands with a fungal Miasma (That claimed the apple yard)
- Sea creatures took over the Cove with the transformed Siren
- Cultists bearing the Iron Crown symbol spread throughout all regions, worshipping the entity and acting as its emissaries

The hamlet fought for survival as these horrors emerged:
- The Guard Captain coordinated defense from the watchtower, until his death
- Bertram (now known as the Fanatic), the previous head Abbot, fought undead with consecrated flame
- Townspeople burned the Manor after finding the Ancestor's body
- Ward stones were repositioned to contain the farmstead's corruption
- Palisade walls were built for protection
- Many died in these early battles

GEOGRAPHY:
The Estate occupies isolated, treacherous terrain:

- The Old Road approaches the hamlet from the southwest through the dense Weald
- The Weald is a corrupted forest bordering the hamlet to the west and south
- The Hamlet sits in the shadow of a northern hill, with the Manor ruins looming atop it
- The Manor and its underground Ruins contain the remnants of the ancestral home
- The Warrens are ancient tunnels beneath the manor, now home to pigmen abominations
- The Cove lies to the northeast, reached by a cliff path beneath the manor's hill
- The Eastern Sea borders the estate to the east, with distant Eastern Isles visible
- The Courtyard lies at the end of path leading northwest from the Dower House
- The corrupted Farmstead lies to the south, encircled by the Ancestor's ward stones

A makeshift palisade wall surrounds the hamlet, providing minimal protection from the horrors beyond. The Caretaker's stagecoach remains the primary connection to the outside world, traveling the Old Road to bring supplies and new recruits.

The Hamlet itself is divided into districts:
- Center: Town square with the Ancestor's statue, constabulary, and market
- Northwest: Dower House, town hall, and library
- North: Abbey, graveyard, and religious establishments
- Northeast: Scientific buildings from the Ancestor's excavation efforts
- East: Harbor district with docks and shadier establishments
- Southeast: Guild hall, blacksmith, and apothecary
- South: Granary, town well, and paths to the farmstead
- Southwest: Inn, tavern, and brothel
- West: Provisionist and sanitarium
