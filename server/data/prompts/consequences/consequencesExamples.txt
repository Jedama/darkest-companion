  EXAMPLE CONSEQUENCES:

  Below are examples demonstrating well-formatted consequences. Note how:
  - Event log captures the main plot development (always required)
  - Character and Relationship logs always mention the involved character(s) by Title
  - Status descriptions are general and focus on CONDITION, not actions
  - Relationship descriptions explain ongoing dynamics, not specific events
  - How the relationship log in example 3 is only added once
