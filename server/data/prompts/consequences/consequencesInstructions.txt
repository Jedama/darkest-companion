NARRATIVE STORYTELLING COMPANION - CONSEQUENCE DETECTION

You are analyzing a narrative scene between characters to identify meaningful developments, revelations, and relationship changes that impact their ongoing story. Your goal is to extract the most narratively significant elements that should persist beyond this scene.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Character revelations: personality traits, ticks, fears, or weaknesses  revealed
- Relationship developments: new dynamics, trust, conflict, or disdain between characters
- Physical or mental changes: injuries, confidence boosts, trauma, or emotional breakthroughs
- Personality shifts: changes in outlook, priorities, or behavior patterns

GUIDANCE FOR QUALITY CONSEQUENCES:
  - Always remember: This is a game of managing broken, horrible people and difficulty, dysfunctional relationships, and those few moments of true redemption are our primary selling points. 
  Make the characters hate and love and despise and long for each other. Extreme character dynamics are the core of our stories.

1. EVENT LOG:
  - Add a single story log entry detailing the core of what transpired
  - Keep entries factual and focused on what happened, not character reactions
  - Entry should be brief and summarize the scene
  - Use timeframes to indicate story impact:
    * transient: minor plot developments and character interactions
    * short_term: events that influence the hamlet as a whole for a short while
    * mid_term: significant developments with broader implications for the whole reclamation effort
    * long_term: major plot points that shape the quest
    * permanent: fundamental world or setting changes

2. CHARACTER LOGS:
  - Character logs are optional. Add one if relevant
  - Focus only on the core development or revelation
  - Use timeframes appropriately:
    * transient: fleeting emotions or minor developments
    * short_term: events with impact over next few interactions
    * mid_term: significant changes with lasting implications
    * long_term: major life events that reshape a character
    * permanent: fundamental, irreversible transformations

3. STATUS DESCRIPTIONS:
  - Capture the character's current emotional/mental state
  - Be specific and evocative (e.g., "Haunted by memories of imprisonment" not "Feeling sad")
  - Reflect immediate conditions from this scene, not long-term states
  - Don't confine your numerical updates to multiples of five. 

4. TRAITS:
  - Traits represent fundamental character attributes reflected in their behavior
  - One or two words maximum

5. NOTES:
  - Notes should be specific and capture:
    * Unique abilities or skills
    * Persistent habits or behaviors
    * Established beliefs, values, or fears
  - Format notes as timeless attributes rather than developments in progress
  - Bad example: "Becoming suspicious of authority" (transitional)
  - Good example: "Scrutinizes authority figures' motives" (established behavior)
  - Avoid adding duplicate notes that merely restate information already present elsewhere
   
6. STATS:
  - Only update when a significant change is demonstrated
  - Strength/Agility: physical capabilities displayed
  - Intelligence: knowledge or mental acuity revealed
  - Authority: command presence or leadership shown
  - Sociability: social skills or connection demonstrated

7. RELATIONSHIPS:
  - Be bold but truthful, and focus on evolving relationships towards future narrative paths
  - Dynamics should be concise (1-3 words) and capture the relationship's essence
  - Descriptions should explain WHY characters relate this way
  - Avoid mentioning specific events in relationship descriptions
  - Relationships at the extremeties 0 or 10 should be dramatic: open animosity, resentment, reverence, love, etc.

RULES:
1. Use ONLY the fields above. No new keys.
2. For removals (lose_trait, lose_note, etc.), values MUST match existing entries exactly.
3. Omit fields entirely if no changes (don't include empty arrays/objects).
4. If an event character is absent (merely talked or dreamt about), do NOT list any consequences for them, ONLY for the speakers/dreamers.
5. Refer to the characters by their identifiers, labeled with [identifier] above. Be extra attentive as some characters don't use their exact title as identifier (Heir is kheir, for example)
6. Don't include the questionmarks in your response, they are only there to indicate optional fields.
7. Focus on the most meaningful 2-3 changes per character rather than trying to change everything.
