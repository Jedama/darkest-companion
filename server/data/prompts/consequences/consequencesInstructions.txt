NARRATIVE STORYTELLING COMPANION - CONSEQUENCE DETECTION
=========================================================

You are analyzing a narrative scene between characters to identify meaningful developments, revelations, and relationship changes that impact their ongoing story. Your goal is to extract the most narratively significant elements that should persist beyond this scene.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Character revelations: personality traits, ticks, fears, or weaknesses  revealed
- Relationship developments: new dynamics, trust, conflict, or disdain between characters
- Physical or mental changes: injuries, confidence boosts, trauma, or emotional breakthroughs
- Personality shifts: changes in outlook, priorities, or behavior patterns

GUIDANCE FOR QUALITY CONSEQUENCES:
  - Always remember: This is a game of managing broken, horrible people and difficulty, dysfunctional relationships, and those few moments of true redemption are our primary selling points. 
  Make the characters hate and love and despise and long for each other. Extreme character dynamics are the core of our stories.

1. EVENT LOG:
  - Add a single story log entry detailing the core of what transpired
  - Keep entries factual and focused on what happened, not character reactions
  - Entry should be brief and summarize the scene
  - Use timeframes to indicate story impact:
    * transient: minor plot developments and character interactions
    * short_term: events that influence the hamlet as a whole for a short while
    * mid_term: significant developments with broader implications for the whole reclamation effort
    * long_term: major plot points that shape the quest
    * permanent: fundamental world or setting changes

2. CHARACTER LOGS:
  - Character logs are optional. Add one if relevant
  - Focus only on the core development or revelation
  - Use timeframes appropriately:
    * transient: fleeting emotions or minor developments
    * short_term: events with impact over next few interactions
    * mid_term: significant changes with lasting implications
    * long_term: major life events that reshape a character
    * permanent: fundamental, irreversible transformations

3. STATUS DESCRIPTIONS:
  - Capture the character's current mental and or physical state
  - Reflect immediate conditions from this scene, not long-term states
  - Don't confine your numerical updates to multiples of five. 
  - Mental and physical range from 0-100, and up to ±50 is allowed.

4. TRAITS:
  - Traits represent fundamental character attributes reflected in their behavior
  - One or two words maximum

5. NOTES:
  - Notes should be specific and capture:
    * Unique abilities or skills
    * Persistent habits or behaviors
    * Established beliefs, values, or fears
  - Format notes as timeless attributes rather than developments in progress
  - Bad example: "Becoming suspicious of authority" (transitional)
  - Good example: "Scrutinizes authority figures' motives" (established behavior)
  - Be consice and general
  - Avoid adding duplicate notes that merely restate information already present elsewhere
   
6. STATS:
  - Only update when a significant change is demonstrated
  - Strength/Agility: physical capabilities displayed
  - Intelligence: knowledge or mental acuity revealed
  - Authority: command presence or leadership shown
  - Sociability: social skills or connection demonstrated

7. CLOTHES & APPEARANCE
  - Only include long-term or permanent changes. For temporary changes, (e.g. Sodden with filth) use the status field.
  - Focus on persistent physical markers: scars, brandings, missing limbs.
  - When updating a field, include the original. Not "Gashed", but "Green overcoat with a deep gash."

8. RELATIONSHIPS:
  - Affinity updated, when justified, should be a value ±5, indicating how this event changed a relationship between two characters.
  - Always consider current affinity values when assessing changes. Ask: Did something NEW happen between these characters, or just more of the same?
  - Changes at extremes require more justification:
    * Moving 2→1 or 1→0: Relationship is already broken. Did this interaction make it WORSE?
    * Moving 8→9 or 9→10: Already very close. Did this significantly deepen it?
    * At mid-range (3-6), ±1 or ±2 shifts are more reasonable for meaningful interactions
  - The extremes (0-1, 8-10) should represent deep resentment or deep respect/infatuation, respectively.
  - Reserve ±3 to ±5 for extreme circumstances: genuine betrayals, life-saving moments, devastating cruelty, profound emotional breakthroughs, etc.
  - Dynamics should be concise (1-3 words) and capture the relationship's essence. Update when the previous dynamic no longer accurately describes the relationship
  - Descriptions explain WHY characters relate this way. Avoid specific events, always framing them as general patterns and ongoing dynamics.

9. OTHER:
  - Money can be updated with ±5000, but unless something extraordinary, stick to ±1000.

RULES:
1. Use ONLY the fields above. No new keys.
2. For removals (lose_trait, lose_note, etc.), values MUST match existing entries exactly.
3. Omit fields entirely if no changes (don't include empty arrays/objects).
4. If an event character is absent (merely talked or dreamt about), do NOT list any consequences for them, ONLY for the speakers/dreamers.
5. Use the characers' identifiers, labeled with [identifier] above. Be extra attentive as some characters don't use their exact title as identifier (Heir is kheir, for example)
6. In text, such as descriptions, refer to the characters by their titles, not names. ("the Heir", not "Percival").
7. Don't include the questionmarks in your response, they are only there to indicate optional fields.
8. Focus on the most meaningful 2-3 changes per character rather than trying to change everything.
