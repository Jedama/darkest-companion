The heirs arrived at their ancestral estate with one dead, one wounded, and a growing question about the cost of their inheritance.",

  "narratives": [
    "The Heir froze while the Highwayman bled out on the Old Road, and everyone present knows it. The Crusader saw a man with a letter opener hiding behind a tree while his companion died. The Heiress has deflected blame onto the sabotaged stagecoach and the brigands, but her brother's uselessness is no longer an abstract concern — it has a corpse attached to it. The Heir's position in the estate now depends entirely on proving his worth behind a desk, because the road has already judged him.",
    "The Heiress dismissed the Highwayman's death with pragmatic composure, and her brother followed her lead — the man was a hired criminal, after all. But the Crusader carried the body. He dug the ground. He said the words. If the heirs treat every recruit as a disposable asset, the Crusader may be the first to ask what that makes him. As more fighters arrive at the Hamlet, how the heirs value the lives they spend will define whether anyone trusts their leadership."

He didn't know the Highwayman long — a few hours on a bad road — but the man shared his bread without being asked, and that means something to a farmer's son. He has no headstone, so he stacks rocks and recites the rites of the Light over a man who probably never prayed a day in his life.",

Beneath the torn fabric, a welt has risen and split — she hasn't shown it to anyone, and won't. She chose the robe over the sanitarium because a leader doesn't bleed in public. The shop is empty, the seamstress long gone, and for the first time since receiving the Ancestor's letter she has nothing to command and no one to command it to.",

She assured him on the road that the Highwayman was expendable — a fugitive, a killer, hired muscle and nothing more. The Heir repeats this to himself. But the man had shared their ride here, been willing to aid their desperate cause, and the Heir can still see the exact way he fell. He drinks to make the image stop. His sister watches him do it and does not drink herself.",
