STRICT JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output contains "estate_log" object, "narratives" array, and "follow_up_events" array as root keys
- No extra text, no markdown

RULES:
1. Narratives are plain strings. No structure, no metadata. Each must stand alone as self-contained context.
2. The narratives array is the COMPLETE list of active narratives after this review. Omitted narratives are considered resolved.
3. Maximum 8 narratives. Empty slots are fine.
4. Follow-up event characters MUST use identifiers from the character roster.
5. Follow-up event descriptions should be specific — name what happened, reference injuries, objects, locations, and character dynamics. Do not write generic setups.
6. Aim for around 3-5 follow-up events.
